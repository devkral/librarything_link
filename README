Installation:
Open a "new bookmark"-dialog (if the bookmark has no address line: save the bookmark and edit it).
Insert the content of bookmarklet_via_title_ready.txt in the address line and name the bookmark like you want.

"Compiling":
new method: Use converter script: convert_to_bookmarklet.sh (sorry, had no good idea how I should call it) 
old method: Remove the newlines in bookmarklet_via_title.txt until you have one line left.

bookmarklet_via_title.txt is just for a better overview over the code. 
to_library_thing_name_transformation.js is for people wanting a script in their website


Hacking:
Every statement has to end with ; except functions and if clauses when they end with }. Comments with // need a space after // Elsewise I can't be sure that I don't delete a http:// statement

Thanks:
Thanks to @work for his brilliant example.
